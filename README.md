# HttpWebTester

This solution will eventually house a full web and load test engine, editor and reporting tool, along with an API service that can be used to run the tests. The projects are as follows:
## HttpWebTesting
This project contains the test object itself.
## HttpWebTester.ConsoleApp
a command line executable used for testing an (eventually) running the application locally.
## HttpWebTesting.Editor
a WPF application for creating and editing the web tests
## HttpWebTesting.SampleTest
contains the code to generate a sample test for validating all of the webtest objects
